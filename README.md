# k-means-clustering

K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithme and a common example of data clustering. It is a centroid-based algorithme in which data are separated into a predetermined K number of clusters/groups based on some similarities.

<!--K-Means Clustering aims to group data points by putting together the similar one and to minimize the variation within each cluster. It aims to partion n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest means.-->

“K-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster.” – [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering)
